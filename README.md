# DSA Customiser

## Introduction

- User Experience has been one of the main challenges in the DeFi space especially engaging layman users/users who are non-developers but have good DeFi knowledge

- To Solve this Instadapp we have platforms like Instadapp which focus on User Experience especially where a User can track their respective DeFi positions through just 1 platform & recently they introduced DSA to boost developer engagement from Non-Blockchain/Non-Ethereum background and of course the users.


#### Our Solution

- We have come up with a solution built on top of DSA through which you can customize your DeFi DSA Spells across all protocols currently supported by the DSA.
- DSA Customiser is our attempt to build a simple User-Friendly layer on top of DSA, by which users can execute spells of their own, track their positions across various protocols through a simple interface.
- Even if you don't have a DSA Created you can get one created by just connecting your Metamask Wallet.
- You can execute any recipie of your choice, you can refer to the InstaDapp DSA Usecases to get some ideas. 

[NOTE -> Currently we support ETH, DAI & USDC as a submission to this hack & 1 DSA per wallet, we will try and introduce these features later]
